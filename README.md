On account of qutrits as we used to carry out it utilizing the two-qubit paradigm however now as we are getting to the higher states utilizing the qiskit pulse, We are currently shortening our execution of qutrits with simply a solitary qubit. 

As we have execution of our Bit flip gate and phase flip is finished by qiskit pulse itself, we can carry out mulit qutrit gate utilizing the cross resonance gate utilized in the qiskit beat. Making a similar worldview of qubits yet set up qutrits
